Problem Statement:
Remove Dups: Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list.

Follow up: How would you solve this problem if a temporary buffer is not allowed?

Hint 1: Have you tried a hash table? You should be able to do this in a single pass of the linked list.
Hint 2: Without extra space, you'll need O(N**2) time. Try using two pointers, where the second one searches ahead of the first one.
