Problem Statement:
Palindrome Permutation - Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome.
A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A permutation is a rearrangement of letters.
The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.
Example:
Input: Tact Coa
Ouput: True (permutations: 'taco cat', 'atco cta', etc.)

Hint 1: You do not have to - and should not - generate all permutations. This would be very inefficient.
Hint 2: What characteristics would a string that is a permutation of a palindrome have?
Hint 3: Have you tried a hash table? You should be able to get this down to O(N) time.
Hint 4: Can you reduce the space uasge by using a bit vector?
